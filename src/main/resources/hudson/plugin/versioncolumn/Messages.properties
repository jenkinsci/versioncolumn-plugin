JVMVersionMonitor.MarkedOffline=Making {0} offline temporarily due to using an incompatible JVM version between agent and controller (controller={1}, agent={2})
JVMVersionMonitor.RUNTIME_GREATER_OR_EQUAL_MASTER_BYTECODE=Agent runtime must be greater or equal than the Controller bytecode level (strongly recommended minimum)
JVMVersionMonitor.MAJOR_MINOR_MATCH=Agent major.minor must be equal to Controller major.minor JVM version (paranoid version)
JVMVersionMonitor.EXACT_MATCH=Agent JVM version must be exactly the same as Controller JVM version (paranoid++ version)

JVMVersionMonitor.UnrecognizedAgentJVM=The agent JVM version {0} is not recognized by the plugin. You might want to open a ticket for the maintainer to complete the compatibility list.
