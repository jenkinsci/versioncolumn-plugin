VersionMonitor.MarkedOffline=Making {0} offline temporarily due to the use of an old agent.jar

JVMVersionMonitor.DisplayName=JVM Version
JVMVersionMonitor.OfflineCause=This node is offline because the JVM version of the agent is incompatible with the controller one.
JVMVersionMonitor.MarkedOffline=Making {0} offline temporarily due to using an incompatible JVM version between agent and controller (controller={1}, agent={2})
JVMVersionMonitor.RUNTIME_GREATER_OR_EQUAL_MASTER_BYTECODE=Agent must run a JVM whose feature-release counter (e.g., 11 or 17) is greater than or equal to that of the controller (strongly recommended minimum)
JVMVersionMonitor.MAJOR_MINOR_MATCH=Agent must run a JVM whose version number (e.g., 11.0.17 or 17.0.4.1) is greater than or equal to that of the controller (paranoid version)
JVMVersionMonitor.EXACT_MATCH=Agent must run a JVM whose version number (e.g., 11.0.17 or 17.0.4.1) is equal to that of the controller (paranoid++ version)

JVMVersionMonitor.UnrecognizedAgentJVM=The agent JVM version {0} is not recognized by the plugin. You might want to open a ticket for the maintainer to complete the compatibility list.
