  When enabled, this monitor will disconnect agents that are not running the <strong>same version</strong> of remoting as the version on the Jenkins controller.
  This monitor does not provide any concept of compatibility between remoting versions.
  <p>
  <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/#readme">Jenkins remoting</a> implements the communication layer between Jenkins controllers and Jenkins agents.
  Recent remoting versions are generally compatible with one another.
  This check enforces a more strict requirement that the remoting version on the agent must exactly match the remoting version on the controller.
  The check can help an administrator quickly identify outdated remoting versions.
