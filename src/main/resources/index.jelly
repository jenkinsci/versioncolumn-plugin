    This plugin offers two node monitors, which makes available two additional columns under the "Manage Nodes"
    (/computer) page.

    <ul>
        <li>One for Remoting version in use</li>
        <li>One for JVM version in use</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each monitor includes a way to make temporarily offline the agents that do not use the same/compatible version
        than
        the one on the Master node.
    </p>
