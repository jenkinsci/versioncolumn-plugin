= Versions Node Monitors Plugin

This plugin offers two _node monitors_:

* Remoting Version
* JVM Version

== Remoting Version Node Monitor

NOTE: The link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/master/README.md[remoting module] handles the network connection between the Jenkins controller and agents.

This monitor will disconnect an agent if it is not running the same version of remoting library as the version on the Jenkins controller.

== JVM Version Node Monitor

This monitor offers 3 levels of monitoring:

[cols="2", options="header,border"]
|===
| Level
| Description & Examples

| `Default`
a| Agent must run a JVM whose **major** version is greater or equal than the one the controller is running (strongly recommended minimum).

Even without this plugin, it is **critical** to the health of your Jenkins cluster that the agent JVM major version **match** the controller JVM major version.

**Examples**:

* Java 7     agent **will be disconnected** from a Java 8u222 controller
* Java 8u172 agent will not be disconnected from a Java 8u222 controller
* Java 8u222 agent will not be disconnected from a Java 8u172 controller
* Java 8u222 agent will not be disconnected from a Java 8u222 controller
* Java 11.03 agent will not be disconnected from a Java 8u222 controller
* Java 8u222 agent **will be disconnected** from a Java 11.03 controller
* Java 11.03 agent will not be disconnected from a Java 11.04 controller
* Java 11.04 agent will not be disconnected from a Java 11.04 controller

| `Paranoid`
a| Agent must run a JVM whose **major.minor** version is greater or equal to the controller version (avoid issues already seen by users).

**Examples**:

* Java 7     agent **will be disconnected** from a Java 8u222 controller
* Java 8u172 agent **will be disconnected** from a Java 8u222 controller
* Java 8u222 agent will not be disconnected from a Java 8u172 controller
* Java 8u222 agent will not be disconnected from a Java 8u222 controller
* Java 11.03 agent will not be disconnected from a Java 8u222 controller
* Java 8u222 agent **will be disconnected** from a Java 11.03 controller
* Java 11.03 agent **will be disconnected** from a Java 11.04 controller
* Java 11.04 agent will not be disconnected from a Java 11.04 controller

| `Paranoid++`
a| Agent must run a JVM whose version is *exactly* equal to the controller version (most paranoid option)

**Examples**:

* Java 7     agent **will be disconnected** from a Java 8u222 controller
* Java 8u172 agent **will be disconnected** from a Java 8u222 controller
* Java 8u222 agent **will be disconnected** from a Java 8u172 controller
* Java 8u222 agent will not be disconnected from a Java 8u222 controller
* Java 11.03 agent **will be disconnected** from a Java 8u222 controller
* Java 8u222 agent **will be disconnected** from a Java 11.03 controller
* Java 11.03 agent **will be disconnected** from a Java 11.04 controller
* Java 11.04 agent will not be disconnected from a Java 11.04 controller
